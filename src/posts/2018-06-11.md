title: Sensu status on LEDs
description: Displaying broken/erroring sensors in the Real World

* At a recent hack day I worked on building a way to display our Sensu sensors on LEDs
* Uses a Raspberry PI Zero to run [an Express API](https://github.com/imjoehaines/sensu-led-controller)
  * The API uses [`pigpio`](https://github.com/fivdi/pigpio) to turn LEDs on & off
* A [PHP Sensu handler](https://github.com/imjoehaines/sensu-led-controller-handler) is used to interact with the API when it receives events from Sensu
* [Demo on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTWFRIUKvxY)
