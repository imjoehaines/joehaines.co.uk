title: Decorators (WIP)
description: and why they're the best
---
A decorator is a function or class that can extend the capabilities of another function or class without inheriting from it. It allows new code to add or alter behaviour while the existing code remains unchanged.

In JavaScript (and much of the functional world) decorators will usually be functions:

```js
const shouty = string => string + '!'
const extraShouty = string => string.toUpperCase()
const sayHi = string => 'Hi ' + string

console.log(shouty(extraShouty(sayHi('Bob')))) // 'HI BOB!'
```

All of these functions accept and return the same type (a `String` in this case) so they can be used independently, or in any combination.

In PHP (and much of the OOP world) decorators are usually classes, which means they will also usually implement the same interface as the classes they are decorating. In my [Flowder](https://github.com/imjoehaines/flowder) library I use decorators to allow maximum flexibility when configuring fixture loading. For example, there is a [`PhpFileLoader`](https://github.com/imjoehaines/flowder/blob/145ad96abd049ab4dc30427c374578001359e73f/src/Loader/PhpFileLoader.php) which can load data from a PHP file. To extend this to deal with directories there is also a [`DirectoryLoader`](https://github.com/imjoehaines/flowder/blob/145ad96abd049ab4dc30427c374578001359e73f/src/Loader/DirectoryLoader.php) class, which takes any class implementing [`LoaderInterface`](https://github.com/imjoehaines/flowder/blob/145ad96abd049ab4dc30427c374578001359e73f/src/Loader/LoaderInterface.php) and calls its `load` method for every file inside a given directory.

In order to load a directory of fixture files, a `PhpFileLoader` and `DirectoryLoader` are composed together

```php
$loader = new DirectoryLoader(
    new PhpFileLoader()
);
```
